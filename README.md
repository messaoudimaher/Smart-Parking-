# Nateg_Enet-com_Smart_Parking_Project 

### PROJECT : DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING A PREPAID SMART RECOGNITION VEHICLES FOR AN ELECTRONIC TOLL SYSTEM using Raspberry Pi 4


### WEB PLATFORM SOURCE CODE :

https://smart-parking-nateg.firebaseapp.com

The project contain two interfaces one for the client and the other for the Master Web
This platform will facilitate the interaction with a client.
Throw this platform a client can:

1. Buy one of our available membership
2. Check his balance
3. Register to our system
4. Visualize his history of payment
5. Manage and setting his account
6. Read messages (Why he was unable to access to a parking)

On the other side the admin will verify and manage all registered accounts
But his main role is to approve and activate the account of a new client after
payment.
In this platform our team will use:

-Angular 8 as a FRONT-END framwork for the front end developing
- Firebase as a BACK-END to maintain the availability and the scalability of data .
